            Data&nbsp;binding at both design-time and run-time&nbsp;is fully supported, and a wide 
            variety of data sources can be used.</p>
        <h3>
            Data Binding at Design-Time</h3>
        <blockquote dir="ltr">
            <p>
                    Data binding can be accomplished at design-time using the Data Source 
                    Configuration Wizard. To use the Data Source Configuration Wizard, click 
                    the chart to see the chart properties, then click the drop-down button for the 
                    DataSource property (as shown in the figure below), and then click the <b>Add 
                    Project Data Source</b> Link.</p>
            <p align="left">
                <img alt="Data Binding" border="0" src="DataSource.jpg" /></p>
            <p align="left">
                Alternatively, you can also double-click the Chart control and click the value 
                cell of the DataSourceID property to open the Data Source Configuration Wizard.</p>

        <h3>
            Data Binding at Run-Time</h3>
        <blockquote dir="ltr">
            <p>
                There are a wide variety of data binding methods that can be used at run-time, 
                ranging from simple to more complex and powerful methods. Run-time data binding 
                gives you significant freedom and flexibility over how the data is bound.</p>
            <p>
                Binding from multiple data sources is supported. For example, a series X value 
                can be bound to an&nbsp;array of strings, and&nbsp;Y values can be bound to&nbsp;a DataReader.</p>
            <p>
                The following decision tree can be used as a guideline when deciding how to bind 
                the data:</p>
