<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
	<P><U>Accumulation Distribution</U>:&nbsp; This indicator uses a relationship between 
		volume and prices to estimate the strength of price movements, and if volume is 
		increased there is a high probability that prices will go up.
	</P>
	<P><U>Chaikin Oscillator</U>: This indicator is the difference between a 3-day exponential 
		moving average and a 10-day exponential moving average applied to the 
		Accumulation Distribution. Using the Chaikin Oscillator it is possible to 
		monitor volume flow for a market.
	</P>
	<P><U>Ease of Movement</U>: This indicator deals with the relationship between volume and 
		price change, and uses volume to indicate how strong a trend is for prices.
	</P>
	<P><U>Money Flow</U>: The money flow indicator compares upward changes and downward 
		changes of volume-weighted typical prices. This indicator is similar to the 
		relative strength index, the difference being the volume-weighted prices.
	</P>
	<P><U>Negative Volume Index</U>: The Negative Volume Index should be used together with 
		the Positive Volume index. The Negative Volume Index only changes if the volume 
		decreases from the previous day.
	</P>
	<P><U>On Balance Volume</U>: On Balance Volume is one of the first volume indicators that 
		measures positive and negative volume flow. Volume is added if the closing 
		price increases and subtracted if the closing price decreases.
	</P>
	<P><U>Positive Volume Index</U>: The Positive Volume Index should be used together with 
		the Negative Volume index. The Positive volume index only changes if the 
		volume decreases from the previous day.
	</P>
	<P><U>Price Volume Trend</U>: The Price Volume Trend is a cumulative volume total that is 
		calculated using relative changes of the Close price, and should be used with 
		other indicators.
