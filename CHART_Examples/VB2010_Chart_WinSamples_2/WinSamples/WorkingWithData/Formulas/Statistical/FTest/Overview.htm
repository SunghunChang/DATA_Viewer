			This sample performs an F Test using F distribution. The F Test is used to see 
			if two samples have different variances. The appearance of a red region in the 
			Distribution chart area means that a hypothesis is rejected, while the 
			appearance of a green region indicates that a hypothesis is accepted.
		</P>
		<P>The first chart area displays two groups of data (column charts), which are used 
			as input.</P>
