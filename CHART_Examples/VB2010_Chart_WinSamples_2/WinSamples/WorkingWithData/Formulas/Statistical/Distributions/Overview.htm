			This sample demonstrates three statistical distributions: Normal distribution, 
			T Distribution (also called Student’s distribution) and F Distribution.
		</P>
		<P>The Distribution cumulative function is shown as a background picture. The red 
			area represents the selected probability percentage of area below the 
			distribution function, and can be symmetric to the mean of distribution (called 
			two-tailed probability).
		</P>
		<P>Normal distribution does not have a degree of freedom. T distribution (i.e. 
			Student’s distribution) has one degree of freedom while F distribution has two 
			degrees of freedom.
