            Data can be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>added at either run-time or design-time (data binding is available at 
                design-time). </li>
            <li>automatically adjusted for missing data using empty point support. </li>
            <li>manipulated using financial or statistical formulas. </li>
            <li>manipulated using copy, filter, group, merge, and split operations. </li>
            <li>displayed using true&nbsp;DateTime values.</li>
        </ul>

            Chart Data Basics</h3>
        <blockquote dir="ltr">
            <p>
                All data is plotted as a series, and each series consists of a related group of 
                data points.</p>
            <p>
                Each data point consists of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>one or more Y values, which are the value(s) of the data points; </li>
                <li>an optional X value that may determine where along the X axis a&nbsp;point is 
                    plotted.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Most chart types use one Y value.&nbsp; However, charts such as bubble, 
                candlestick, range and stock chart types&nbsp;require more than one Y value since one 
                data point consists of multiple values. For example, to plot one stock chart 
                column four values are required: high, low, open and close.</p>

        <h3>
            Adding Data</h3>
        <blockquote dir="ltr">
            <p>
                There are two ways to add data to a chart: using data binding or non-data 
                binding techniques.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both&nbsp;methods can be used at either&nbsp;design-time or run-time.</p>
            <h4>
                Data Binding</h4>
            <blockquote dir="ltr">
                <p>
                    Data binding can be accomplished at design-time using the Data Source 
                    Configuration Wizard. To use the Data Source Configuration Wizard, click 
                    the chart to see the chart properties, then click the drop-down button for the 
                    DataSource property (as shown in the figure below), and then click the <b>Add 
                    Project Data Source</b> Link.</p>
                <p align="left">
                    <img alt="Data Binding" border="0" src="DataSource.jpg" /><br />
                </p>
                <p>
                    Data&nbsp;binding at run-time is very powerful.&nbsp;There are a variety of binding 
                    methods that can be used, starting from simple and ranging to more complex.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <h4>
                Data Sources</h4>
            <blockquote dir="ltr">
                <p>
                    The Chart control can bind to a variety of data sources, including all&nbsp;standard 
                    or custom objects that implement the&nbsp;IEnumerable interface. For example: 
                    DataView, DataReader,&nbsp;DataSet, DataRow, DataColumn, Array, List, SqlCommand, 
                    OleDbCommand, SqlDataAdapter, and OleDbDataAdapter objects.
                </p>

        <h3>
            Missing and Empty Data</h3>
        <blockquote dir="ltr">
            <p>
                A data source may contain missing data.&nbsp;The Chart control handles this by 
                optionally representing missing data with empty points (see the figure below).</p>
            <p align="left">
                <img alt="Data Binding" border="0" 
                    src="MissingPoints.PNG" /><br />
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>
            Data Manipulation</h3>
        <blockquote dir="ltr">
            <p>
                The Chart control can perform common data manipulation tasks, such as copying, 
                filtering, grouping, merging, and splitting data. It also includes numerous 
                statistical and financial formulas, enabling you to get the most out of your 
                data.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>
            DateTime Support</h3>
        <blockquote dir="ltr">
            <p>
                The Chart control can use DateTime objects for date/time values. It can then 
                render the date/time format that you specify, making the rendered chart easy to 
                read.</p>
